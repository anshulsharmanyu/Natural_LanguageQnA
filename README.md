# Natural_LanguageQnA
This project is a FastAPI-based question-answering system that extracts relevant answers from a dataset of member messages. Users can ask natural language questions like “Where did Layla travel last month?” or “What is Vikram’s favorite restaurant?” and receive conversational responses grounded in actual message history.
